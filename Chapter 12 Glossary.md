## **AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems**

### **Agentic AI**
A form of artificial intelligence where AI systems act autonomously to complete tasks, make decisions, and interact with other AI agents or humans.

### **Autonomous Agent**
An AI system that operates independently without human intervention, using learning algorithms to adapt to different situations.

### **Hierarchical Agents**
A structured approach where AI agents are organized in a hierarchy, with high-level agents delegating tasks to lower-level agents.

### **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**
A system where multiple AI agents work together to accomplish tasks, either through collaboration, competition, or self-organization.

### **Self-Orchestration**
The ability of AI agents to coordinate tasks, manage workflows, and optimize operations autonomously without a central controller.

### **Swarm Intelligence**
A decentralized AI approach where multiple simple agents work together to achieve complex behaviors, inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks.

### **Task Delegation in AI Agents**
The process where a high-level agent assigns tasks to sub-agents based on expertise and available resources.

## **Generative AI Concepts**

### **Fine-Tuning**
The process of training a pre-existing AI model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to improve its performance in specialized tasks.

### **Function Calling**
A method that allows AI models to interact with APIs and external tools dynamically, enabling automation and tool integration.

### **Memory in AI Agents**
The ability of an AI agent to store and retrieve past interactions, enabling context-aware conversations and decision-making.

### **Prompt Engineering**
The technique of crafting specific and optimized inputs (prompts) to guide an AI model's responses effectively.

### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
An AI technique that enhances responses by pulling information from external databases or knowledge sources before generating text.

### **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**
A training method where AI models learn by receiving human-generated feedback on their responses to improve behavior over time.

### **Tokenization**
The process of breaking down text into smaller components (tokens) that AI models can process and analyze.

## **Key AI Technologies & Frameworks**

### **Claude API**
Anthropic’s AI API designed for structured reasoning, AI alignment, and safety-focused generative AI applications.

### **Gemini API**
Google’s multi-modal AI model API designed for advanced reasoning, agent-based workflows, and tool integration.

### **LangChain**
A framework for building applications that integrate AI models with external data sources and tools for reasoning and memory management.

### **Microsoft AutoGen**
A multi-agent AI framework that enables structured agent collaborations for enterprise and research applications.

### **Mistral AI**
An open-weight AI model optimized for fast, efficient generative AI processing, used for AI agent development.

### **OpenAI Agents SDK**
A toolkit for building autonomous AI agents capable of multi-turn conversations, decision-making, and workflow execution.

### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
A standardized framework that enables AI agents to **share, retain, and manage contextual knowledge across interactions**. MCP enhances **long-term memory retention, structured decision logging, and context-aware AI collaboration**. It ensures AI agents maintain coherent, transparent, and ethical decision-making by providing **governance over shared AI memory and state management**.

### **Vector Databases (Weaviate, Pinecone, FAISS)**
Databases optimized for storing and retrieving AI embeddings, improving search relevance and memory recall in AI agents.

## **Ethics & AI Governance Terms**

### **AI Alignment**
Ensuring AI systems' objectives and behaviors align with human values and societal norms.

### **AI Bias**
Unintended prejudices in AI models due to imbalanced training data or flawed algorithms, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

### **Explainable AI (XAI)**
Techniques that make AI decision-making more transparent and interpretable, helping users understand how AI arrives at its conclusions.

### **Fairness Audits**
Systematic evaluations of AI systems to detect biases and ensure equitable treatment across different demographic groups.

### **Federated Learning**
A privacy-preserving AI training method where models learn from decentralized datasets without sharing raw data.

### **Privacy-Preserving AI**
AI techniques (e.g., differential privacy, zero-trust models) that prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### **Regulatory Frameworks for AI**
- **EU AI Act:** Risk-based classification of AI systems for legal compliance.
- **US AI Executive Order:** Policies for AI safety and ethics.
- **OECD AI Principles:** International guidelines for responsible AI development.
- **ISO/IEC AI Ethics Standards:** Global compliance for AI governance in enterprise settings.
