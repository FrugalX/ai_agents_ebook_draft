# Chapter 2: Generative AI APIs: Getting Started

## **2.1 Overview of OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Llama, and Mistral APIs**

Generative AI APIs provide easy access to powerful AI models for generating text, images, and other outputs. Here is an overview of the key APIs:

### **OpenAI API**

- **Main Features**: Offers access to GPT models for text generation, code assistance, and conversation.
- **Use Cases**: Writing, summarization, coding assistance, and creative tasks.
- **Agents SDK & Responses API**: OpenAI has introduced the **Agents SDK** and **Responses API**, which provide more flexible and dynamic AI interactions. These tools replace the earlier Assistants API, offering improved function-calling capabilities, memory handling, and multi-agent workflows.
- **Documentation**: Available at OpenAI’s website.

### **Gemini API**

- **Main Features**: Google’s Gemini models focus on multi-modal capabilities (text, images, etc.).
- **Use Cases**: Cross-modal tasks such as captioning images or combining text and visuals.
- **Documentation**: Provides tools and guides to integrate multi-modal AI into applications.

### **Claude API** (Anthropic)

- **Main Features**: Claude is designed with an emphasis on safety, reasoning, and reliability.
- **Use Cases**: AI-assisted decision-making, conversational AI, and enterprise integrations.
- **Documentation**: Found on Anthropic’s developer portal.

### **Llama API** (Meta)

- **Main Features**: Meta’s Llama models, designed for efficient NLP tasks.
- **Use Cases**: Open-source AI deployment for research and development.
- **Documentation**: Available through Meta’s AI research pages.

### **Mistral API**

- **Main Features**: Open-weight models optimized for flexible and transparent AI development.
- **Use Cases**: Text generation, chatbot applications, research projects.
- **Documentation**: Found on Mistral’s developer site.

## **2.2 How Generative AI Models Work (Simplified)**

Generative AI models are built using deep learning architectures, primarily transformer-based networks. Here’s a simplified breakdown:

1. **Training**:

   - Models are trained on large datasets to learn patterns and relationships.

2. **Generation**:

   - Based on an input prompt, the model predicts the next word or image pattern iteratively.

3. **Fine-Tuning**:

   - APIs provide fine-tuning options for specialized use cases.

### **Advanced Capabilities**:

- **Function Calling**: The Responses API can invoke external functions based on input prompts.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines external knowledge sources with AI responses.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Enables AI to break complex queries into smaller reasoning steps.

### **Diagram: Evolution from Rule-Based Systems to Autonomous AI Agents**

Below is an illustrative representation of how AI has evolved over time:

1. **Rule-Based Systems** → Predefined if-else logic for decision-making.
2. **Statistical Models** → Data-driven probabilistic decision-making.
3. **Machine Learning Models** → Models trained on data for classification and regression tasks.
4. **Deep Learning & Transformers** → Neural networks powering generative AI and NLP.
5. **Autonomous AI Agents** → AI-powered workflows, multi-agent collaboration, and function-calling.

*(Insert a visual diagram here showing the progression from rule-based systems to fully autonomous AI agents.)*

## **2.4 Your First Generative AI API Call**

### **2.4.1 Using OpenAI’s Responses API with Function Calling**

#### **Python Example**:

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that provides weather information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in New York?"}
    ]
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

#### **JavaScript Example**:

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

async function getResponse() {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4-turbo",
        messages: [
            { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant that provides weather information." },
            { role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in New York?" }
        ]
    });
    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
getResponse();
```

### **2.4.2 Using Gemini API**

#### **Python Example**:

```python
from google.generativeai import GenerativeModel
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
response = model.generate_content("Explain quantum mechanics.")
print(response.text)
```

#### **JavaScript Example**:

```javascript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function getGeminiResponse() {
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
        model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
        systemInstruction: "You are a knowledgeable physics tutor. Explain complex topics in a clear and concise way."
    });
    const result = await model.generateContent("Explain quantum mechanics.");
    console.log(result.response.text());
}
getGeminiResponse();
```
